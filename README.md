### It captures and analyzes IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets, providing insights into source/destination IP addresses and ports

# ðŸš€ Key Features
 
Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting:

Diagnosing Network Problems: Network sniffers help identify network issues such as slow performance, bottlenecks, and connectivity problems by analyzing traffic patterns and pinpointing problematic areas.
Bandwidth Utilization: They monitor bandwidth usage to detect excessive consumption by certain devices or applications, helping in optimizing network performance.
Security Analysis:

Intrusion Detection: Sniffers can detect suspicious activities and potential security breaches by monitoring for unusual traffic patterns, unauthorized access attempts, and known attack signatures.
Network Forensics: In the event of a security incident, sniffers provide detailed packet-level data, aiding in the investigation and reconstruction of the incident.
Protocol Analysis:

Protocol Debugging: Developers use sniffers to analyze the behavior of network protocols, ensuring they function correctly and efficiently. This is crucial for debugging and improving networked applications.
Protocol Compliance: Ensuring that network devices and software comply with standard protocols and communicate correctly.
Performance Analysis:

Application Performance: By analyzing the traffic between applications and their servers, sniffers can identify performance issues and latency problems.
Quality of Service (QoS): Sniffers help in monitoring QoS parameters to ensure that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and performance levels.
Data Collection for Reporting and Auditing:

Network Usage Reports: Regular monitoring and logging of network traffic can generate reports on usage patterns, which are useful for capacity planning and resource allocation.
Compliance Audits: Organizations may use sniffers to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements by monitoring and logging network activity.
